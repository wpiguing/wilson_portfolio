                <p>As an intern, and eventually as a technician, I was tasked with the upkeep of content within the IUN webspace.
                    With the use of the Cascade CMS and knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, I took part in major collaborative projects
                    such as website content refreshes, ADA web content accessibility, and framework transitions.

                    experience in object-oriented languages such Python and Java. Some Adobe Creative Cloud applications
                    that I have working knowledge with include Illustrator, Photoshop, and Premiere. I strive to constantly
                    improve my skill set, and have been expanding my knowledge of PHP and jQuery. Moreover, I'm also working

                <p>Content creation is a passion of mine. Whether it's coding/learning new technologies or covering songs with
                    my piano and guitar, I spend much of my free time making things that I find enjoyable. I also create
