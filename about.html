                <p>Hello there! My name is Wilson, and I'm an aspiring developer. Officially, I'm a web technician for Indiana
                    University Northwest. I help with the ongoing implementation of content in the IUN webspace using the
                    Cascade Server web content management system. Collaborating closely with the campus Office of Marketing
                    and Communications, I also get to assist other content managers in achieving content accessibility.</br>

                        Which really means . . .</span>
                    I get to make really cool things, and at the same time, help other people with their own cool things!

                <h3>IU Northwest - Web Technician</h3>
                <p>As an intern, and eventually as a technician, I was tasked with everyday tasks pertaining to the upkeep of
                    content within the IUN webspace. With the use of the Cascade CMS and knowledge of HTML and CSS, I took
                    part in major collaborative projects such as ADA web content accessibility, framework transitions, and
                    website content refreshes.

                <h3>IU Northwest - Service Technician</h3>
                <p>Prior to becoming a part of IUN's Web team, I was a service technician specializing in addressing computer
                    hardware and software problems. I worked closely with users of all types including students, faculty,
                    and staff in troubleshooting issues on both Windows and Mac platforms.

                <h3>Education - IUN Class of 2017</h3>
                <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in both Computer Information Systems and Business Administration.
                    I was able to make either the Dean's or Chancellor's List in all of my 9 semesters while averaging a
                    3.78 GPA.

                <h3>Some Fun Facts</h3>
                <p>I like spending time with various forms of content creation. There's the obvious such as coding and continuously
                    learning in my spare time. However, I also enjoy covering songs with my piano and guitar. I also love
                    video games, and generating creative videos for both my YouTube and Twitch channels.
